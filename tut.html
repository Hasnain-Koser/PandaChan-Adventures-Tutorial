      <p>
          PandaChan was tasked with an important mission to excavate the ancient ruins in the middle of a
          dangerous valley where a mad scientist had discovered the secrets to teleportation.
          You(PandaChan) venture off into the center of the valley and begin your work at excavating the ruins.
          As you are about to finish up with a few bits left at the corners, suddenly the door is trapped with heavy
          bricks and you are unable to escape. Soon you feel a strange feeling as if the air was getting supercharged.
          And before you can react the wooden bots equipped with sharp swords ready to attack you.
          The longer you are able to fend them off, the more bots he is able to spawn. but the super charged air also
          gives you an advantage as every once in a while when you are powered up you can heal yourself by a
          certain amount. Additionally there are also traps in the existing ruin that you can lure the bots into the
          traps and due to their bad design they will be eliminated instantly, but beware, if you come in the way of
          the traps you will be hurt too. Finally, your death is inevitable but the longer you stay, the more
          information you can gather and transmit to the database so the mad scientist can be caught and the world can
          marvel at this beautiful ancient ruins.

          Assuming you just got to know about the situation, you might want to know some vital information - the control
          over your (PandaChan's) body: <br>
          The character can be controlled through the WASD convention. Use the "W" key to move forward, the "S" key to
          move backwards, the "D" key to move right, and the "A" key to move left. <br>
          In order to fully control your chracter you also need to be able to control its direction and have a way to
          effectively look around. You can do this through moving your mouse, your mouse will be able to help you look
          and give you a first person perspective to the character (FPP).

          as you are about to finish. You also have a special device with you that tracks multiple details, such as
          your supercharge on the right side of the screen, the red progress bar which when filled up using
          the "X" key you can convert that energy to health healing you by 10 points. <br>
          You are also able to track your health in the top left corner. Make sure not to let it go down to zero. <br>
          Below your health bar you can also view the amount of data you have transmitted(your score), the more data you transmit,
          the more people benefit from your work, make sure to maximize this. <br>
          Finally there is another secret device given to you, but before they could inform you how to use it, you had
          already left, eager to begin your work at the ruins. See if you can figure out this device on your own,
          it is said to be very effective against the bots if you are able to switch it on and use it properly.

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>
          When you nearly finished excavating the ruin, you also uncovered these traps. Traps are dangerous and can do
          a considerable amount of damage to you, due to their size and weapon. These traps are cubes that will activate
          if you walk in front of them. They have tiny little wheels at the bottom that only move in one direction,
          and hence can only be activated when walking in front of them in a single direction. When activated,
          these traps swiftly move across from wall to wall, and spikes extrude out of these traps damaging the
          player on contact however due to the weak build of the bots, it eliminates them instantly. In order to stay
          alive, you must think quick and fast using these traps to your advantage to get rid of the bots.

      <p>
          Enemies, They will continuously try to follow you and harm you, however they don't have ranged but melee
          weapons(Swords), so they need to come close to you to land their attack. This is what gives you an advantage, as they
          follow you, you can create their path, ultimately leading them to their doom. But beware, the longer you stay,
          the more supercharged the air gets, and this helps the mad scientist send in more and more bots to lead you
          to your demise. Since the traps are lethal and can eliminate these bots instantly, the scientist has engineered
          them so that they are not able to set off any traps, which means you must do this yourself. Finally, the more
          bots you eliminate, the more data you are able to gather and transmit! so make sure to get as many of those
          evil little machines as you can.
